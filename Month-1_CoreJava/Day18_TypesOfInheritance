Theory: Types of Inheritance

Inheritance allows one class to acquire properties and methods of another class using the extends keyword.

1. Single Inheritance

One child class inherits from one parent class.

Simple and commonly used.

Example: Child → Parent

2. Multilevel Inheritance

A class inherits from a child class (chain inheritance).

Example: GrandChild → Child → Parent

3. Hierarchical Inheritance

Multiple child classes inherit from the same parent class.

Example: Child1 → Parent, Child2 → Parent

4. Multiple Inheritance (Not supported using classes)

Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes to avoid ambiguity.

Achieved using interfaces.
Why we cannot achieve multiple inheritance using classs?
ANS:In java, we cannot achieve multiple inheritance class beacause of 2 main reasons 
1)Ambiquity while method-calling
2)Ambiquity while Constructor-chaining/calling
Diamond Problem: means even though, if we declare different in super class still we face ambiquity problem.That is when both the super classes extends to supermost class called class object,it inherits all the eleven methods which is present in both the super classes and when we try to call these methods in childclass it causes ambiquity error 
this is called diamond problem.

// Day 18: Types of Inheritance in Java

// Parent class
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal eats food");
        // Common behavior for all animals
    }
}

// Single Inheritance: Dog inherits from Animal
class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
        // Specific behavior of Dog
    }
}

// Multilevel Inheritance: Puppy inherits from Dog (Animal -> Dog -> Puppy)
class Puppy extends Dog {
    void play() {
        System.out.println("Puppy plays");
        // Specific behavior of Puppy
    }
}

// Hierarchical Inheritance: Cat also inherits from Animal
class Cat extends Animal {
    void meow() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
        // Specific behavior of Cat
    }
}

public class TypesOfInheritanceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Single Inheritance example
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.eat();   // Inherited from Animal
        dog.bark();  // Dog's own method

        // Multilevel Inheritance example
        Puppy puppy = new Puppy();
        puppy.eat();   // From Animal
        puppy.bark();  // From Dog
        puppy.play();  // From Puppy

        // Hierarchical Inheritance example
        Cat cat = new Cat();
        cat.eat();   // Inherited from Animal
        cat.meow();  // Cat's own method
    }
}
Output:
Animal eats food
Dog barks
Animal eats food
Dog barks
Puppy plays
Animal eats food
Cat meows
