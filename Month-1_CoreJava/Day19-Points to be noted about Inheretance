By using Inheritance we can inherit variables and methods but not constructor and blocks
"final" class cannot have subclass(final class cannot be inherited)
ex:final class Parent
   { 
   }
   class Child extends Parent
   {
    }
it does not workout it gets error because,
1)They are few inbuilt final classes which cannot be extended
a)String
b)Scanner
c)System
d)StringBuilder
e)Stringbuffer
2)final class cannot be inherited but we can access the properities and behaviour of final class by creating the object.
3)final class itself can inherit from its superclass.but it doesnot allow thesubclass/child to inherit it.
How to avoid inheritance for a class?
Ans:By declaring the class as "final"
    By declaring the "private construct" in a "class".
    private members of class cannot be inherited but it can be accessed.
Eg:
class Father
{ 
long money=150000;
private String gfname:"Aliabat";
void Laugh()
{
}
void talk()
{
}
private void Smoke()
{
}
}
class Son extends Father
